There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Connect with your relatives ##
  > Family Ledger helps you connect with your relatives by establishing relationships. Share photos, stories, recipes and anything else that you want to remember together.

## Who is it for? ##
  > Anyone who wants to share with family and store memories in a central, accessible place.

## Summary ##
  > Our families are the foundation of our identity. With family, we form a lasting connection with the past and the future. To remember loved ones and share new experiences, Family Ledger helps you build a secure online family tree. Once this network is established, you can search and share content based upon your relationships with your family members.

## Problem ##
  > Grandma makes the best peach pie you've ever tasted. Her recipe has been passed down to you on an index card, edgeworn and written in her imperfect but endearing cursive. How can you make sure that your whole family has access to Grandma's peach pie recipe? You could snap a photo of it and email it to everyone, which is easy, or type it out and send a document instead, which is more searchable but takes a bit longer. Either way, it will most likely get lost in your family's email inboxes, and they probably won't find it if they need it a month from now. 

## Solution ##
  > Log in to your Family Ledger, and save the recipe there. Tag your grandma in the recipe, and anyone who wants to see her recipes will be able to find it online. You can add multiple files - such as photos and documents - and save them as one memory. Others can add files and comments, i.e. 'Here's a photo of my version, just baked it this morning!'; 'Looks great, Grandma would be proud!'
