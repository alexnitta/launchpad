## A place for family stories
The main inspiration for this project is to create a repository for family stories and allow the user to relate in a meaningful way to the people in those stories. The definition of 'family' is loose, and can include anyone the group chooses to invite. Stories include artifacts like photos, videos, and documents that anyone in the group can contribute. The ledger is a shared resource that collects these stories and artifacts into a central place.
