Technologies:
- Deploy to DigitalOcean with MEAN stack

Objectives:
- get better at Angular
- learn how to write unit tests
- get better at MongoDB

Project Phases:
- Phase 1: User can create a username and password, log in and log out
  - authentication with salted + hashed passwords
  - sessions
  - creation of users in database
  - creation of families in database
  
- Phase 2: User can establish relationships with family members
  - browse anyone in family
  - establish a relationship
  - edit a relationship established by someone else

- Phase 3: User can view a family tree
  - display each family member's name, relationship to others
  
  
  Workflow:
    - spin up Digital Ocean MEAN stack
    - set up file structure
    - set up Node
    - set up Grunt for task management
    - set up Mocha / Chai / Sinon for testing
    - set up Angular MVC
    - set up Mongoose db schema

  - have Digital Ocean droplet up and running
  
  To Do:
    - edit Gruntfile to properly deploy via push - https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-automatic-deployment-with-git-with-a-vps
    - edit Gruntfile to have real task sets for deploy in --dev vs. --prod

  Something is missing from library.min.js.
